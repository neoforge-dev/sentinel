# Active Context

## Current Focus

Building the core agent components and configuration:
- Enhanced agent implementation with task planning and code generation
- Configuration management for different models
- Tool execution framework with pluggable tools
- Error handling and optimization configurations
- Version control setup

## Recent Changes

1. Created the initial project structure
2. Implemented a simple MCP server using FastAPI
3. Created a basic agent that communicates with Ollama
4. Developed a setup script for easy installation
5. Updated documentation in README.md
6. Established memory-bank for project continuity
7. Created .gitignore and initialized Git repository
8. Implemented enhanced agent.py with UV annotations and advanced capabilities
9. Added model configuration system in JSON format
10. Created examples for extending the agent with custom tools
11. Added configuration loading utilities

## Next Steps

1. **Test the MCP server** - Ensure it correctly stores and retrieves context
2. **Test the agent** - Verify it communicates with Ollama and the MCP server
3. **Implement external tool integrations** - Connect to real-world APIs and services
4. **Add streaming response support** - Improve user experience with streaming responses
5. **Add persistent storage for MCP** - Replace in-memory storage with database backend
6. **Setup CI/CD pipeline** - Add automated testing and deployment

## Active Decisions

1. **API Design for MCP** - Using RESTful API with FastAPI for simplicity and flexibility
2. **Agent Architecture** - Single-file agents for portability and ease of use
3. **Context Storage** - Using in-memory storage initially, may add persistent storage later
4. **Default Models** - Using Mistral 7B as default, with option for DeepSeek R1
5. **UV for Dependencies** - Chosen for modern Python dependency management
6. **Git Version Control** - Repository initialized with comprehensive .gitignore
7. **Task and Model Configuration** - Using JSON configuration for model and task settings
8. **Pluggable Tool System** - Implemented a flexible tool registration system

## Current Considerations

1. Should we add a web UI for managing agents and contexts?
2. How to handle large context windows efficiently?
3. What additional metadata should be stored with context items?
4. How to implement authentication for the MCP server?
5. Should we support other LLM backends beyond Ollama?
6. What remote repository should be used for collaboration?
7. Should we implement a caching layer for model responses?
8. How to optimize the agent for different hardware configurations?
