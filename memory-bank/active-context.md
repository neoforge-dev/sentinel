# Active Context

## Current Focus

Refactoring/fixing the `test_fix_code` function in `examples/test_runner_plugin.py` which is causing a fixture error during test collection. This involves either moving it to the `tests/` directory and making it a proper test, or changing its signature if it's meant as a utility function.

## Recent Changes

1. Created the initial project structure
2. Implemented a simple MCP server using FastAPI
3. Created a basic agent that communicates with Ollama
4. Developed a setup script for easy installation
5. Updated documentation in README.md
6. Established memory-bank for project continuity
7. Created .gitignore and initialized Git repository
8. Implemented enhanced agent.py with UV annotations and advanced capabilities
9. Added model configuration system in JSON format
10. Created examples for extending the agent with custom tools
11. Added configuration loading utilities
12. Implemented code analysis MCP server with Ruff integration
13. Created test runner MCP server with local and Docker support
14. Developed plugins for agent to interact with specialized MCP servers
15. Added unit tests and documentation for new components
16. Created unified MCP integration module (mcp_integration.py)
17. Developed MCPEnhancedAgent to integrate all MCP services
18. Created demonstration script showcasing all capabilities
19. Ran `make test` and identified numerous test failures.
20. Systematically fixed errors in unit tests related to imports, mocking (patch targets, return values, assertion logic), fixtures (`sample_project_path`, async `client`), asynchronous operations, API endpoint logic (`run_tests_docker`, `list_test_results`), and exception handling.
21. Deleted the outdated/incorrect test file `tests/test_plugins/test_test_analysis_plugin.py`.
22. Updated memory bank (`progress.md`, `active-context.md`).

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve `test_fix_code` Error**: Refactor or move the function causing the `fixture 'code' not found` error.
2. **Commit Changes**: Commit the fixes made to the test suite.
3. **Add Persistent Storage**: Add database backend for Code MCP server.
4. **Implement Authentication**: Add basic authentication for MCP servers.
5. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance recovery from server failures.
6. **Add More Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks.
7. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline**: Add automated testing and deployment.
8. **Add Streaming Support**: Implement streaming for tests and agent responses.
9. **Create Comprehensive Testing**: Add integration tests.

## Active Decisions

*No new major decisions. Focusing on stabilizing tests.*

## Current Considerations

*Decide on the best approach for `test_fix_code` (move vs. refactor).*
