# Active Context

## Current Focus

Integrating specialized MCP servers with the main agent:
- Creating a unified integration module for all MCP servers
- Developing an enhanced agent with code analysis and test runner capabilities
- Supporting both programmatic and interactive usage
- Adding demonstrations of the integrated features
- Ensuring robust error handling and graceful degradation

## Recent Changes

1. Created the initial project structure
2. Implemented a simple MCP server using FastAPI
3. Created a basic agent that communicates with Ollama
4. Developed a setup script for easy installation
5. Updated documentation in README.md
6. Established memory-bank for project continuity
7. Created .gitignore and initialized Git repository
8. Implemented enhanced agent.py with UV annotations and advanced capabilities
9. Added model configuration system in JSON format
10. Created examples for extending the agent with custom tools
11. Added configuration loading utilities
12. Implemented code analysis MCP server with Ruff integration
13. Created test runner MCP server with local and Docker support
14. Developed plugins for agent to interact with specialized MCP servers
15. Added unit tests and documentation for new components
16. Created unified MCP integration module (mcp_integration.py)
17. Developed MCPEnhancedAgent to integrate all MCP services
18. Created demonstration script showcasing all capabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Add persistent storage for MCP servers** - Replace in-memory storage with database backend
2. **Implement authentication for MCP servers** - Add basic authentication for security
3. **Improve error handling and resiliency** - Enhance recovery from server failures
4. **Add more test frameworks** - Support more testing frameworks beyond pytest and unittest
5. **Setup CI/CD pipeline** - Add automated testing and deployment
6. **Add streaming support for test results** - Provide real-time test results during execution
7. **Create comprehensive testing** - Test all components together with integration tests

## Active Decisions

1. **API Design for MCP** - Using RESTful API with FastAPI for simplicity and flexibility
2. **Agent Architecture** - Single-file agents for portability and ease of use
3. **Context Storage** - Using in-memory storage initially, may add persistent storage later
4. **Default Models** - Using Mistral 7B as default, with option for DeepSeek R1
5. **UV for Dependencies** - Chosen for modern Python dependency management
6. **Git Version Control** - Repository initialized with comprehensive .gitignore
7. **Task and Model Configuration** - Using JSON configuration for model and task settings
8. **Pluggable Tool System** - Implemented a flexible tool registration system
9. **Specialized MCP Servers** - Creating purpose-specific MCP servers for code analysis and testing
10. **Token Budget Management** - Implementing token counting to optimize output for LLMs
11. **Local and Docker Test Execution** - Supporting both local and containerized test execution
12. **Unified Integration Module** - Created a single module to manage all MCP server interactions
13. **Enhanced Agent Design** - Extended OllamaAgent with specialized MCP capabilities
14. **Command-Based Interface** - Added special commands in the enhanced agent for testing and analysis

## Current Considerations

1. Should we add a web UI for managing agents and contexts?
2. How to handle large context windows efficiently?
3. What additional metadata should be stored with context items?
4. How to implement authentication for the MCP servers?
5. Should we support other LLM backends beyond Ollama?
6. What remote repository should be used for collaboration?
7. Should we implement a caching layer for model responses?
8. How to optimize the agent for different hardware configurations?
9. Should we merge the specialized MCP servers into one unified server?
10. How should we handle versioning for MCP server APIs?
11. What's the best way to handle MCP server process management?
12. Should we implement a discovery mechanism for MCP servers?
