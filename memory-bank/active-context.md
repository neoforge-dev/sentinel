# Active Context

## Current Focus

Implementing authentication for MCP servers using a simple API key strategy.

## Recent Changes

1. Created the initial project structure
2. Implemented a simple MCP server using FastAPI
3. Created a basic agent that communicates with Ollama
4. Developed a setup script for easy installation
5. Updated documentation in README.md
6. Established memory-bank for project continuity
7. Created .gitignore and initialized Git repository
8. Implemented enhanced agent.py with UV annotations and advanced capabilities
9. Added model configuration system in JSON format
10. Created examples for extending the agent with custom tools
11. Added configuration loading utilities
12. Implemented code analysis MCP server with Ruff integration
13. Created test runner MCP server with local and Docker support
14. Developed plugins for agent to interact with specialized MCP servers
15. Added unit tests and documentation for new components
16. Created unified MCP integration module (mcp_integration.py)
17. Developed MCPEnhancedAgent to integrate all MCP services
18. Created demonstration script showcasing all capabilities
19. Ran `make test` and identified numerous test failures.
20. Systematically fixed errors in unit tests related to imports, mocking (patch targets, return values, assertion logic), fixtures (`sample_project_path`, async `client`), asynchronous operations, API endpoint logic (`run_tests_docker`, `list_test_results`), and exception handling.
21. Deleted the outdated/incorrect test file `tests/test_plugins/test_test_analysis_plugin.py`.
22. Updated memory bank (`progress.md`, `active-context.md`).
23. Integrated database backend for snippet storage in Code MCP server.
24. Updated Code MCP server tests to mock database interactions.
25. Implemented API Key authentication:
    - Created `src/security.py` with `verify_api_key` dependency.
    - Added `Depends(verify_api_key)` to all MCP server endpoints.
    - Updated agent plugins to send `X-API-Key` header.
    - Updated server unit tests for authentication.

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Plugin Tests**: Manually update plugin unit tests to fully verify API key header usage.
2. **Refactor `TestMCPTestServer`**: Convert unittest-style tests to pytest fixtures for consistency.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance recovery from server failures.
4. **Add More Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks.
5. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline**: Add automated testing and deployment.
6. **Add Streaming Support**: Implement streaming for tests and agent responses.
7. **Create Comprehensive Testing**: Add integration tests.
8. **Refactor `test_fix_code` Error**: Address the fixture error.

## Active Decisions

*Using simple API Key (X-API-Key header) for initial MCP authentication.*

## Current Considerations

*Need to securely manage the actual API key(s) in deployment (e.g., Vault, proper env management).*
*Consider more robust authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, JWT) if requirements evolve.*
*Address the remaining test failures in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` due to mixed test styles.*
