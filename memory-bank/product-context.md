# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Many developers want to run AI agents locally for privacy, customization, and reduced costs. However, setting up and integrating local LLMs with context management is complex and requires multiple tools working together.

## Solution

BaseAgent solves this by integrating:
- **Ollama**: For running local LLMs efficiently
- **UV**: For Python dependency management
- **MCP**: For context management across agent sessions

## Target Users

- AI developers who want to run models locally
- Researchers experimenting with context-aware agents
- Developers building privacy-focused applications
- Organizations wanting to keep their data on-premises

## Key User Experience Goals

1. **Simple Setup**: Users should be able to set up and run BaseAgent with minimal steps
2. **Flexible Integration**: Support different LLMs through Ollama
3. **Context Persistence**: Maintain context across agent runs through MCP
4. **Single-File Agents**: Allow creating powerful agents in a single file

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: User installs Ollama, UV, and sets up BaseAgent
2. **MCP Server**: Starts the MCP server to manage context
3. **Agent Creation**: Creates or uses existing agent implementations
4. **Interaction**: The agent communicates with Ollama for LLM capabilities and MCP for context
5. **Development**: Users can extend the agent or MCP functionality as needed

## Expected Benefits

- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally
- **Cost Efficiency**: No API usage fees
- **Customization**: Full control over agents and models
- **Context Management**: Persistent context across sessions
- **Simplicity**: Single-file agents are easy to create and share
