# Project Progress

## Key Working Features
- **Core Agent**: Ollama integration, basic conversation loop.
- **MCP Servers**: 
    - Code (8081): Ruff analysis/format/fix, Snippet DB storage.
    - Test (8082): pytest/unittest/nose2 (local/Docker), Result DB storage, Streaming.
- **Persistence**: SQLite (`DatabaseManager`).
- **Auth**: Basic API Key (`X-API-Key`).
- **Testing**: Unit & Integration tests, CI (lint, test).
- **Deployment**: Basic CD (Docker build/push to GHCR).
- **UI**: Basic Streamlit app (test running w/ streaming).
- **Deps**: Managed via UV (`requirements.txt`).
- **Key Fixes**: Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`).

## What's Left / Next Steps
- **High Priority:**
    - Achieve stable, fully passing test suite (address warnings, Docker issues).
    - Consistent logging approach.
    - Consistent error handling patterns.
    - Ensure Docker test result storage in DB is correct.
- **Medium Priority:**
    - Enhance Web UI functionality.
    - Integrate additional practical tools.
    - Address Docker `pip` as root warnings.
    - Improve test coverage (edge cases).
- **Low Priority / Future:**
    - Advanced context filtering / management.
    - Agent templating.
    - Performance benchmarks.
    - Automated deployment beyond image push.
    - Client-side error handling (circuit breaking?).
    - CLI improvements.
    - Multi-model support.

## Known Issues
- `pytest-asyncio` warnings during test execution.
- Docker runs `pip` as root (warning).
- Basic API key auth (consider enhancement later).
- Limited model testing (Mistral, DeepSeek).

## Current Status Summary
- Core functionality operational.
- Local and Docker test execution modes implemented.
- Focus on stabilizing tests and resolving warnings.
- Sample tests designed to fail/error (`tests/test_sample`) now marked as `xfail`, allowing main suite to pass.

## What Works

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - MCP Code Server (port 8081) is functional for code analysis and transformation
   - MCP Test Server (port 8082) is operational for test execution
   - Communication between components via FastAPI endpoints is established
   - Standardized JSON-based communication layer between all system components

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Local test execution with `run_tests_local` functions correctly
   - Docker test execution with `run_tests_docker` is implemented but has some error handling issues
   - Test results are properly reported for successful tests

3. **Agent Framework**:
   - Basic agent implementation structure is in place
   - Agent communication with MCP servers is functional

4. **Documentation**:
   - Documentation of architectural constraints and design patterns
   - Documentation of error propagation and resource management strategies
   - Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - More robust Docker test execution error handling
   - Better path resolution for flexible deployment
   - Improved error reporting for Docker failures

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Reduce Docker overhead for faster test execution
   - Optimize resource usage during concurrent test runs

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Complete SQLite integration for persistent storage
   - Add comprehensive logging system
   - Implement monitoring for system health

## Current Status

The project has a functional core with both local and Docker test execution capabilities. The system architecture is established with separate servers for code and test operations. Recent focus has been on documentation updates and standardizing technical components.

### Key Accomplishments:
- Established the MCP architecture with separate code and test servers
- Implemented both local and Docker test execution modes
- Created comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank
- Standardized server ports and communication protocols

### Current Challenges:
- Docker test execution has some error handling issues
- Path resolution requires specific configuration (development mode or PYTHONPATH)
- pytest-asyncio warnings need to be addressed
- Docker permissions can cause issues if not properly configured

## Known Issues

1. **Technical Issues**:
   - pytest-asyncio warnings during test execution
   - Path resolution requires either development mode installation or PYTHONPATH setting
   - Docker permissions must be properly configured
   - Potential port conflicts if standard ports are already in use

2. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Need more detailed setup instructions for first-time users
   - Better documentation of error messages and troubleshooting steps

3. **Testing Gaps**:
   - More comprehensive tests needed for edge cases
   - Better test coverage for Docker execution failures
   - Additional integration tests for the complete system

4. **Warnings from pytest-asyncio about fixture usage**
5. **Docker running pip as root warnings**
6. **Potential for similar logic issues in other parts of the codebase that need review**

## Known Issues

1. **Basic Authentication**: Authentication uses a simple shared API key; more robust methods may be needed.
2. **Limited Model Support**: Currently only tested with Mistral and DeepSeek models
3. **Limited Streaming**: Only local test execution streams output. Docker test streaming is deferred due to complexity.
4. **Basic Error Handling**: Plugins use basic retry; more specific HTTP error handling could be added.
5. **Plugin Error Handling**: Plugins have retry logic and handle common HTTP errors; server-side error reporting could be more detailed.
6. **Server Error Handling**: Both Test and Code servers now raise more specific HTTP errors for common failure modes (e.g., missing dependencies, bad config, DB errors).
7. **Integration Test Coverage**: Good coverage for core server APIs and agent interactions, including different runners. Further edge cases could be added.
8. **Deployment**: Basic CD pushes images to GHCR. No automated deployment to a live environment yet.
9. **Streaming responses for Docker tests (Caveat: DB storage of final result needs review)**
10. **Enhanced Web UI (Mode Selection)**
11. **Enhanced Web UI (Stream Output Parsing)**
12. **Enhanced Error Handling (MCP Test Server - `OSError` in `run_tests_local`)**
13. **Docker Tests**: Tests using Docker execution mode are failing with "error" status instead of "success"/"failed".
14. **Warnings from pytest-asyncio about fixture usage**
15. **Docker running pip as root warnings**
16. **Potential for similar logic issues in other parts of the codebase that need review**

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**
