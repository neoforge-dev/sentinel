## What's Left to Build

- [ ] Command-line interface improvements
- [ ] Persistent storage for MCP servers
- [ ] Authentication for MCP servers
- [ ] Multi-model support in a single session
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for main agent
- [ ] Advanced context filtering
- [ ] Agent template system
- [ ] Additional example agents for different use cases
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Streaming responses for tests and main agent
- [ ] Real-world tool integrations (beyond simulated tools)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Web UI for management
- [ ] Support for additional test frameworks

## Current Status

The project has the core functionality implemented:
- Enhanced agent with task planning and code generation capabilities
- Main MCP server for context management
- Specialized MCP servers for code analysis and test running
- Integration of all MCP servers with the main agent
- Unified MCP client library for managing multiple servers
- Setup script for easy installation
- Configuration system for models and task types
- Tool execution framework with pluggable tools
- Error handling with retry logic
- Hardware optimization based on available resources
- Version control with Git
- Unit tests for specific components
- Detailed documentation
- Demo script for showcasing features

The basic functionality is working with full integration of the MCP servers, but still needs more comprehensive testing.

## Known Issues

1. **In-Memory Storage**: MCP servers currently use in-memory storage, which doesn't persist after restart
2. **No Authentication**: MCP servers have no authentication, making them insecure for production
3. **Limited Model Support**: Currently only tested with Mistral and DeepSeek models
4. **No Streaming**: Responses are not streamed, which can make the UI feel unresponsive for long generations or test runs
5. **Basic Tool Integration**: Tool system works but needs more real-world integrations
6. **Limited Testing**: Automated tests don't cover all components
7. **Separate MCP Servers**: Multiple MCP servers require separate management and configuration
8. **Limited Test Framework Support**: Currently supports only pytest, unittest, and uv

## Next Major Features

1. **Persistent Storage**: Add database backend for MCP servers
2. **Authentication**: Add basic auth for MCP servers
3. **Web UI**: Simple web interface for managing agents and contexts
4. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
5. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for better UX
6. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support for more testing frameworks
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add full test coverage for all components
