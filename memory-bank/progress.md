# Progress

## What Works

- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Basic agent implementation
- [x] MCP server implementation
- [x] Setup script
- [x] README with installation instructions
- [x] Memory bank setup

## What's Left to Build

- [ ] Command-line interface for the agent
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Persistent storage for MCP
- [ ] Authentication for MCP server
- [ ] Multi-model support in a single session
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Advanced context filtering
- [ ] Agent template system
- [ ] Example agents for different use cases

## Current Status

The project has the basic infrastructure set up:
- Agent that can communicate with Ollama LLMs
- MCP server for context management
- Setup script for easy installation
- Documentation for users to get started

The core functionality is working, but needs testing and enhancement for production use.

## Known Issues

1. **In-Memory Storage**: MCP server currently uses in-memory storage, which doesn't persist after restart
2. **No Authentication**: MCP server has no authentication, making it insecure for production
3. **Limited Error Handling**: Need to improve error handling in both agent and MCP server
4. **No Retry Logic**: Agent doesn't retry failed requests to Ollama or MCP
5. **Basic Context Management**: Context management is basic and doesn't handle large contexts efficiently

## Next Major Features

1. **Persistent Storage**: Add database backend for MCP
2. **Authentication**: Add basic auth for MCP server
3. **Web UI**: Simple web interface for managing agents and contexts
4. **Tool Integration**: Allow agents to use tools and external APIs
5. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for better UX
