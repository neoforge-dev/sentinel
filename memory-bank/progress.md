## What's Left to Build

- [ ] Command-line interface improvements
- [ ] Persistent storage for MCP
- [ ] Authentication for MCP server
- [ ] Multi-model support in a single session
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Advanced context filtering
- [ ] Agent template system
- [ ] Additional example agents for different use cases
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Streaming responses
- [ ] Real-world tool integrations (beyond simulated tools)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Web UI for management

## Current Status

The project has the core functionality implemented:
- Enhanced agent with task planning and code generation capabilities
- MCP server for context management
- Setup script for easy installation
- Configuration system for models and task types
- Tool execution framework with pluggable tools
- Error handling with retry logic
- Hardware optimization based on available resources
- Version control with Git

The basic functionality is working but needs thorough testing.

## Known Issues

1. **In-Memory Storage**: MCP server currently uses in-memory storage, which doesn't persist after restart
2. **No Authentication**: MCP server has no authentication, making it insecure for production
3. **Limited Model Support**: Currently only tested with Mistral and DeepSeek models
4. **No Streaming**: Responses are not streamed, which can make the UI feel unresponsive for long generations
5. **Basic Tool Integration**: Tool system works but needs more real-world integrations
6. **Limited Testing**: No automated tests yet

## Next Major Features

1. **Persistent Storage**: Add database backend for MCP
2. **Authentication**: Add basic auth for MCP server
3. **Web UI**: Simple web interface for managing agents and contexts
4. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
5. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for better UX
6. **Testing Suite**: Add comprehensive test suite
