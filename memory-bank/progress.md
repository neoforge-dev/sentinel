# Project Progress

## Key Working Features
- **Core Agent**: Ollama integration, basic conversation loop.
- **MCP Servers**: 
    - Code (8081): Ruff analysis/format/fix, Snippet DB storage.
    - Test (8082): pytest/unittest/nose2 (local/Docker), Result DB storage, Streaming.
- **Persistence**: SQLite (`DatabaseManager`).
- **Auth**: Basic API Key (`X-API-Key`).
- **Testing**: Unit & Integration tests, CI (lint, test).
- **Deployment**: Basic CD (Docker build/push to GHCR).
- **UI**: Basic Streamlit app (test running w/ streaming).
- **Deps**: Managed via UV (`requirements.txt`).
- **Key Fixes**: Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).

## What's Left / Next Steps
- **High Priority:**
    - Achieve stable, fully passing test suite (address warnings, Docker issues).
    - Consistent logging approach.
    - Consistent error handling patterns.
    - Ensure Docker test result storage in DB is correct.
- **Medium Priority:**
    - Enhance Web UI functionality.
    - Integrate additional practical tools.
    - Address Docker `pip` as root warnings.
    - Improve test coverage (edge cases).
- **Low Priority / Future:**
    - Advanced context filtering / management.
- Agent templating.
- Performance benchmarks.
    - Automated deployment beyond image push.
    - Client-side error handling (circuit breaking?).
- CLI improvements.
    - Multi-model support.

## Known Issues
- `pytest-asyncio` warnings during test execution.
- Docker runs `pip` as root (warning).
- Basic API key auth (consider enhancement later).
- Limited model testing (Mistral, DeepSeek).
- Low test coverage (~24% after recent fixes).
- `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped; `/run-tests` endpoint falls back to local for Docker mode.

## Current Status Summary
- Core functionality operational.
- Local and Docker test execution modes implemented.
- Focus on stabilizing tests and resolving warnings.
- Sample tests designed to fail/error (`tests/test_sample`) now marked as `xfail`, allowing main suite to pass.

## What Works

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - MCP Code Server (port 8081) is functional for code analysis and transformation
   - MCP Test Server (port 8082) is operational for test execution
   - Communication between components via FastAPI endpoints is established
   - Standardized JSON-based communication layer between all system components

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Local test execution with `run_tests_local` functions correctly
   - Docker test execution with `run_tests_docker` is implemented but has some error handling issues
   - Test results are properly reported for successful tests

3. **Agent Framework**:
   - Basic agent implementation structure is in place
   - Agent communication with MCP servers is functional

4. **Documentation**:
   - Documentation of architectural constraints and design patterns
   - Documentation of error propagation and resource management strategies
   - Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - More robust Docker test execution error handling
   - Better path resolution for flexible deployment
   - Improved error reporting for Docker failures

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Reduce Docker overhead for faster test execution
   - Optimize resource usage during concurrent test runs

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Complete SQLite integration for persistent storage
   - Add comprehensive logging system
   - Implement monitoring for system health

## Current Status

The project has a functional core with both local and Docker test execution capabilities. The system architecture is established with separate servers for code and test operations. Recent focus has been on documentation updates and standardizing technical components.

### Key Accomplishments:
- Established the MCP architecture with separate code and test servers
- Implemented both local and Docker test execution modes
- Created comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank
- Standardized server ports and communication protocols

### Current Challenges:
- Docker test execution has some error handling issues
- Path resolution requires specific configuration (development mode or PYTHONPATH)
- pytest-asyncio warnings need to be addressed
- Docker permissions can cause issues if not properly configured

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Key Working Features
- **Core Agent**: Ollama integration, basic conversation loop.
- **MCP Servers**:
    - **Code Server**: Ruff analysis, formatting, fixing; Snippet storage (DB).
    - **Test Server**: `pytest`, `unittest`, `nose2` execution (local & Docker); Result storage (DB); Streaming output.
- **Enhanced Agent**: Integrates with MCP servers via plugins; Handles errors w/ retry.
- **Persistence**: SQLite DB via `DatabaseManager`.
- **Authentication**: Basic API Key via `X-API-Key` header.
- **Testing**: Extensive unit & integration tests; CI pipeline (lint, test).
- **Deployment**: Basic CD (Docker image build/push to GHCR).
- **UI**: Basic Streamlit interface for core operations (test running w/ streaming).
- **Dependencies**: Managed via UV (`requirements.txt`).

## What's Left (High Level)

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**

## Key Fixes
- Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (removed unittest class, fixed mocks, streaming, auth checks)
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (resolved import errors, added missing routes, fixed `response_model` issues, fixed async streaming logic, updated assertions).
- [x] Added `/` and `/run-tests` endpoints to `mcp_test_server.py`.
- [x] Refactored streaming logic in `mcp_test_server.py` (`run_tests_local` function) using asyncio Queue.
- [x] Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**

## Key Fixes
- Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (removed unittest class, fixed mocks, streaming, auth checks)
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (resolved import errors, added missing routes, fixed `response_model` issues, fixed async streaming logic, updated assertions).
- [x] Added `/` and `/run-tests` endpoints to `mcp_test_server.py`.
- [x] Refactored streaming logic in `mcp_test_server.py` (`run_tests_local` function) using asyncio Queue.
- [x] Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**

## Key Fixes
- Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (removed unittest class, fixed mocks, streaming, auth checks)
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (resolved import errors, added missing routes, fixed `response_model` issues, fixed async streaming logic, updated assertions).
- [x] Added `/` and `/run-tests` endpoints to `mcp_test_server.py`.
- [x] Refactored streaming logic in `mcp_test_server.py` (`run_tests_local` function) using asyncio Queue.
- [x] Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**

## Key Fixes
- Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (removed unittest class, fixed mocks, streaming, auth checks)
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (resolved import errors, added missing routes, fixed `response_model` issues, fixed async streaming logic, updated assertions).
- [x] Added `/` and `/run-tests` endpoints to `mcp_test_server.py`.
- [x] Refactored streaming logic in `mcp_test_server.py` (`run_tests_local` function) using asyncio Queue.
- [x] Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**

## Key Fixes
- Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (removed unittest class, fixed mocks, streaming, auth checks)
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (resolved import errors, added missing routes, fixed `response_model` issues, fixed async streaming logic, updated assertions).
- [x] Added `/` and `/run-tests` endpoints to `mcp_test_server.py`.
- [x] Refactored streaming logic in `mcp_test_server.py` (`run_tests_local` function) using asyncio Queue.
- [x] Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## Known Issues (Consolidated - Removing Redundant Older Sections)

1.  **Low Test Coverage**: ~24% overall, needs improvement especially for MCP Test Server.
2.  **Skipped/Incomplete Docker Test**: `test_run_tests_docker` is skipped. `/run-tests` endpoint currently falls back to local execution for Docker mode requests.
3.  **`pytest-asyncio` Warnings**: Fixture/loop warnings persist during test runs.
4.  **Docker `pip` Warning**: Docker runs `pip` as root.
5.  **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple shared API key.
6.  **Limited Model Testing**: Primarily tested with Mistral, DeepSeek.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Enhance basic Streamlit UI or build a more robust interface.
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests (**DONE** - Review DB storage).
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more integration tests (**DONE**).
6. **Fix Docker Tests**: Resolve issues with Docker execution mode tests.
7. **Comprehensive test coverage for all features**
8. **Addressing pytest asyncio warnings**
9. **Cleanup of Docker warnings (running pip as root)**
10. **Standardized logging approach across the codebase**

## Key Fixes
- Dependency issues, test errors (unit/integration), streaming implementation (LLM/Test Server), error handling (plugins/servers), port standardization, Python path resolution (`python -m ...`), fixed `mcp_test_server` unit tests (ImportError, NameError, 404s, FastAPI collection error, streaming TypeError).
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (removed unittest class, fixed mocks, streaming, auth checks)
- [x] Refactored and fixed tests in `tests/unit/test_mcp_test_server.py` (resolved import errors, added missing routes, fixed `response_model` issues, fixed async streaming logic, updated assertions).
- [x] Added `/` and `/run-tests` endpoints to `mcp_test_server.py`.
- [x] Refactored streaming logic in `mcp_test_server.py` (`run_tests_local` function) using asyncio Queue.
- [x] Handled intentional failures in sample tests (`tests/test_sample/test_simple.py`) with `xfail`.

## Next Major Goals
- Achieve stable, fully passing test suite.
- Enhance Web UI functionality.
- Integrate additional, practical tools.
