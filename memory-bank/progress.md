## What's Left to Build

- [ ] Command-line interface improvements
- [x] Persistent storage for MCP servers (DB exists, code server integrated)
- [x] Authentication for MCP servers (Basic API Key implemented)
- [ ] Multi-model support in a single session
- [ ] Advanced context filtering
- [ ] Agent template system
- [ ] Additional example agents for different use cases
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Streaming responses for tests (Local execution only)
- [ ] Real-world tool integrations (beyond simulated tools)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Web UI for management
- [ ] Support for additional test frameworks

## Current Status

The project has the core functionality implemented:
- Enhanced agent with task planning and code generation capabilities
- Main MCP server for context management
- Specialized MCP servers for code analysis and test running
- Integration of all MCP servers with the main agent
- Unified MCP client library for managing multiple servers
- Setup script for easy installation
- Configuration system for models and task types
- Tool execution framework with pluggable tools
- Error handling with retry logic
- Hardware optimization based on available resources
- Version control with Git
- Unit tests for specific components
- Detailed documentation
- Demo script for showcasing features

The test suite has been significantly improved, addressing numerous failures and errors related to imports, mocking, fixture usage, and asynchronous operations. Most tests are now passing, providing better verification of component functionality. The MCP test server now uses a database backend for storing results. The MCP Code server has been integrated with the database for snippet storage.

## Known Issues

1. **Basic Authentication**: Authentication uses a simple shared API key; more robust methods may be needed.
2. **Limited Model Support**: Currently only tested with Mistral and DeepSeek models
3. **Limited Streaming**: Only local test execution streams output; Docker tests and agent LLM responses do not.

## Next Major Features

1. **Web UI**: Simple web interface for managing agents and contexts
2. **Tool Integration**: Add more real-world tool integrations
3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for Docker tests and agent LLM responses.
4. **Additional Test Frameworks**: Support for more testing frameworks
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add integration tests.
6. **Refactor test_fix_code**: Move or refactor the function in `examples/test_runner_plugin.py`.
